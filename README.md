## Introduction

Apache Beam is a powerful framework that provides a unified programming model to process both batch and stream data. The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to set up a basic Beam project, define pipelines, and execute data processing tasks.

This Proof of Concept (PoC) is designed for educational and experimental purposes, allowing you to explore Beam's capabilities and integrate it into your own projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Beam Proof of Concept:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mauricionoris/beam-poc.git
  
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd beam-poc
   
3. Install the required dependencies. You may use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt



4. Explore the project structure and understand the components.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

-  beam_poc/: Python module containing the Beam pipeline and processing logic.
-  data/: Sample data files for testing the pipeline.
-  tests/: Unit tests for the pipeline.
-  main.py: The main entry point for executing the Beam pipeline.
  
You can extend and modify the beam_poc/ module to suit your data processing needs.
